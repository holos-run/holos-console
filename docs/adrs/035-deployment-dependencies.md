# ADR 035: Deployment Dependencies via TemplateGrant, TemplateDependency, TemplateRequirement (HOL-954)

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-04-25
- Binary: `holos-console` (multiple packages)
- Follows: [ADR 034 — Namespace TemplatePolicyBinding for new Projects](034-namespace-template-policy-binding-for-new-projects.md)

## Context

Platform owners need to express that certain templates depend on other
templates being deployed alongside them (e.g., every `mcp-server` deployment
requires a shared `waypoint` sidecar). Project-scope declarations
(`TemplateDependency`) let Service Owners declare this within a single project.
Org- or folder-scope mandates (`TemplateRequirement`) let Platform Owners
declare this for all projects under an ancestor without any per-project
configuration.

Cross-namespace template references also require an authorization mechanism
(`TemplateGrant`) to prevent project owners from referencing templates they
do not own.

## Decisions

### Decision 1 — Three new CRDs

Three tightly scoped CRDs are introduced:

| CRD | Scope | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `TemplateGrant` | org or folder namespace | Authorizes cross-namespace template references from listed project namespaces |
| `TemplateDependency` | project namespace | Declares that Deployments from template A require a singleton of template B |
| `TemplateRequirement` | org or folder namespace | Mandates that all Deployments matching `targetRefs[]` require a singleton of template B |

### Decision 2 — Singleton Deployment with refcount owner-refs

The first Deployment that triggers a dependency edge creates a singleton
Deployment in the same project namespace. Subsequent Deployments that match
the same edge add a non-controller `ownerReference` (Controller=false,
BlockOwnerDeletion=true). Native Kubernetes GC reaps the singleton when the
last owner is deleted.

### Decision 3 — Singleton naming

The singleton Deployment name is deterministic:

```
<requires.Name>-<sanitized-versionConstraint>-shared
```

When `VersionConstraint` is empty: `<requires.Name>-shared`.

This ensures idempotent applies and allows Phase 8 (PreflightCheck) to detect
name collisions before apply.

### Decision 4 — cascadeDelete controls owner-ref edge

`cascadeDelete: true` (default) adds the non-controller ownerReference.
`cascadeDelete: false` creates the singleton but skips the ownerReference,
decoupling the singleton's lifecycle from the dependent.

### Decision 5 — TemplateGrant: ReferenceGrant-style authorization

A `TemplateGrant` in namespace `N` grants listed project namespaces access to
templates in `N`. Same-namespace references are always allowed without a grant.
Supports literal namespace, `"*"` wildcard, and `namespaceSelector`.

### Decision 6 — Hard-revoke on grant deletion

When a TemplateGrant is deleted, the TemplateGrantController immediately
removes it from the cache. New cross-namespace materializations are rejected
from that point. Existing materialised singletons are NOT removed — callers
must manage orphan cleanup manually.

### Decision 7 — HOL-554 storage-isolation for TemplateRequirement

`TemplateRequirement` objects stored in project namespaces are ignored by the
ancestor walker (mirrors the existing storage-isolation rule for
`TemplatePolicyBinding`). The CEL ValidatingAdmissionPolicy enforces this at
admission time; the ancestor walker enforces it as belt-and-suspenders.

### Decision 8 — TemplateRequirement targeting

`TemplateRequirement.targetRefs[]` uses the same Kind/Name/ProjectName shape
as `TemplatePolicyBindingTargetRef`. The wildcard `"*"` semantics from ADR 029
apply: `projectName: "*"` matches all projects reachable via the ancestor walk;
`name: "*"` matches all Deployments of that kind within the matched projects.

### Decision 9 — Render order (Open Question 2, resolved)

`TemplatePolicy.Require` runs at render time (unchanged). `TemplateRequirement`
materialises sibling Deployments **after** the dependent's render succeeds.

The ordering is enforced by the controller: it watches Deployment objects and
only calls `EnsureSingletonDependencyDeployment` for Deployments that already
exist as CRs (i.e., whose render has produced a Deployment CR). This avoids
races where the sibling singleton references rendered output that does not yet
exist.

### Decision 10 — TemplateRequirement overlap policy (Open Question 1, resolved)

When two `TemplateRequirement` objects in the same ancestor chain match the
same Deployment:

- **Different `requires` templates**: each requirement is processed
  independently, producing distinct singleton Deployments (one per
  `(requires.namespace, requires.name, requires.versionConstraint)` tuple).
  The union of the required set emerges naturally from this decomposition.

- **Same `(namespace, name)` template with different `versionConstraint`**:
  the sanitized version suffix in the singleton name (`waypoint-v1-shared` vs
  `waypoint-v2-shared`) keeps the two singletons distinct. Phase 8
  (PreflightCheck) surfaces these as potential version conflicts before apply.

- **Same `(namespace, name, versionConstraint)`**: the `EnsureSingleton` call
  is idempotent — it finds the existing singleton and adds the ownerReference
  if missing. The second reconcile is a no-op.

Incompatible `versionConstraint`s on the same `(namespace, name)` pair fail
hard via the Phase 8 `PreflightCheck` RPC (HOL-962) before any apply. The
unit tests in `console/deployments/dependency_reconciler_test.go` cover the
union case; the conflict case is surfaced by PreflightCheck.

### Decision 11 — Grant validation in TemplateRequirementReconciler

Grant validation for `TemplateRequirement` is performed per-Deployment by
`EnsureSingletonDependencyDeployment`, not at the TemplateRequirement level.
This is because the impacted project namespaces are discovered dynamically
(via the wildcard match) and the meaningful authorization boundary is "can
*this Deployment's namespace* use the required template", not "can the org
namespace use the required template".

When a grant is missing for a specific project namespace, the ResolvedRefs
condition reflects GrantNotFound for that reconcile and the reconciler
requeues. When a TemplateGrant is subsequently created, the
TemplateGrantController updates the cache and the reconciler will succeed on
the next reconcile triggered by the Deployment watch.

## Open Questions

Three questions were explicitly deferred to the implementation plan per the
`CONTRIBUTING.md` §"ADR Open Questions" convention.

**Open Question 1 — TemplateRequirement overlap policy** — *Resolved in
[PR #1189](https://github.com/holos-run/holos-console/pull/1189) (HOL-960)*

When two `TemplateRequirement` objects in the same ancestor chain target the
same Deployment, what is the correct overlap behaviour? See Decision 10 above.
The implementation unions the `requires` set: each `(namespace, name,
versionConstraint)` triple produces one singleton; identical triples are
idempotent (EnsureSingleton). Incompatible `versionConstraint` values on the
same `(namespace, name)` pair are rejected hard by the Phase 8 PreflightCheck
RPC before any `kubectl apply` is attempted.

**Open Question 2 — Render order** — *Resolved in
[PR #1189](https://github.com/holos-run/holos-console/pull/1189) (HOL-960)*

Should `TemplatePolicy.Require` (render-time) and `TemplateRequirement`
(controller-time) run in the same pass, or is sequencing required? See Decision
9 above. `TemplatePolicy.Require` continues to run at render time (unchanged);
`TemplateRequirement` materialises sibling Deployments only after the
dependent's render succeeds and produces a Deployment CR. The controller watches
Deployment objects and only calls `EnsureSingletonDependencyDeployment` for
Deployments that already exist as CRs.

**Open Question 3 — PreflightCheck RPC shape** — *Resolved in
[PR #1194](https://github.com/holos-run/holos-console/pull/1194) (HOL-962)*

The request/response message types and the proto location for the
`PreflightCheck` RPC were deferred to the implementation. The RPC is defined in
`proto/holos/console/v1/deployments.proto` as `PreflightCheck` on the
`DeploymentService`. `PreflightCheckRequest` carries `namespace` + optional
`deploymentName`; `PreflightCheckResponse` returns a `conflicts` repeated
message listing each detected name collision or `versionConstraint` conflict.

## Consequences

- Three new CRDs with kubebuilder status subresources and conditions following
  the Gateway-API ADR 030 pattern (Accepted, ResolvedRefs, Ready).
- `EnsureSingletonDependencyDeployment` in `console/deployments` is the shared
  helper for both TemplateDependency and TemplateRequirement reconcilers.
- Deployment CRD promotion (D1, HOL-957) is prerequisite: owner-refs require
  both ends of the edge to be CRs at reconcile time.
- Phase 8 (PreflightCheck, HOL-962) surfaces naming collisions and version
  conflicts before apply.
- Phase 9 (UI, HOL-963) surfaces shared dependency Deployments with a "shared
  dependency" indicator and per-edge cascade-delete toggle.
