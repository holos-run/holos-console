# TODO

1. [ ] Check that go structs are generated from proto files using go generate.

2. [ ] Initialize the vite + react + material ui + connect rpc client with a simple header that gets the current version.

3. [ ] Wire up auth, use Dex as an issuer to start with PKCE.

4. [ ] Wire up a user profile page, store state in a Secret. Make the backend pluggable so it can write to the filesystem instead of the kube API server.
